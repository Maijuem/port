## COVID-19 Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a classic COVID-19 dataset and represents one of my earliest Python data analysis projects. Conducted during a time when the topic was globally relevant, it provided a meaningful opportunity to apply programming skills while exploring real-world data trends.
Exploring global COVID-19 trends using Python, Pandas, and data visualization.

This project was initially developed in Anaconda on my local machine, where I performed the first round of analysis. Later, I migrated the work to Google Colab to continue the development in a cloud-based environment. Through this process, I not only refined the analysis but also gained hands-on experience with Colab as a collaborative, cloud-based data science tool. Finally, I linked the project to GitHub to ensure version control, transparency, and easy sharin
## Exploratory Analysis
- Checked missing values and handled inconsistencies  
- Aggregated case counts by country and date 
- Using functions to search for specific location and time
